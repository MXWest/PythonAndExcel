# PythonAndExcel

Python and Excel studies using `openpyxl`, `pandas`, and `numpy`, as 
taught in the LinkedIn Learning course [_Using Python with Excel_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/using-python-with-excel/).

I'm posting this because:
* I wanted  a place to remember some of these constructs. 
* Software updates have made some course examples obsolete.
* The course is presented very quickly, and it's hard to keep up if you're
typing along with the instructions. 

Place the course's Exercise Files into a directory called `data`, and these examples
should - theoretically - all work fine.

## Installation
